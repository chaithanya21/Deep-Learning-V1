       " 'as is often the case  films about self  loathing characters do not usually make for good drama .  downloading nancy  is no exception . it  s supposedly based on a true story about a woman who  s murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet .  br    br   the protagonist is nancy  maria bello  who is married to albert  rufus sewell  . albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar  restaurants . unlike most human beings  albert has virtually no positive attributes  except for his ability to be successful in the business world  . throughout the film  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . when his wife asks for sex  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead .  br    br   nancy is equally one  note as a character . not only has she had a loveless   year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film  . her self  loathing takes the form of self  mutilation and a result  she  s forced into therapy . however  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made .  br    br   finally  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet . he  s sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . it  s revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  the children  s mother no longer wants anything to do with him  .  br    br   nancy  s plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her . there  s a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . it seems that louis has a two  fold plan in going to see albert   berate him for his treatment of nancy and   enjoy the beating he receives . it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy  s fatefirst  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . nancy  s fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some  feelings  for her  . we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy  s murder .  br    br   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence  is that the main point of the film  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted  i don  t think so . the film  s writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy  s decline . but are people so one  dimensional in real life  i think not . they have the repulsive louis  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy . furthermore  his expressions of love towards nancy  before he kills her   is supposed to show his  sensitive side  .  br    br   in the end  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography .

       " 'well  as goethe once said  there really isn  t any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on  something that has had a great effect  .  la maman et la putain  has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what  s been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film  certainly  should be dissuaded from watching it . to express a purely subjective judgement  however  i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people  don  t watch it it  s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry .  and by that i don  t mean  sick and angry  about  the human condition  or anything so general and profound as that  because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film   an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty  and so on  and  if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort  then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself  however pessimistic his conclusions may be . my beef with the film is rather that i don  t see this hours  long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all . all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree  of course  because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree  because we see the least of her . alexandre  s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value  of course  but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean  pierre laud is most likely not even acting and that  with absurd remarks like  un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray   he really was just reproducing word  for  word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he  along with the director eustache  had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film . i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout     of the film  it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow  worthless and despicable post     milieu . what made  however  this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us . if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman  sleeping  mostly in this very flat  with another  and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third  well  i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog  eat  dog world he  s chosen to create for himself . what i can  t  however  in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his  anxiety  and his  despair  . the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika  whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty . as i say  if  la maman et la putain  is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre  veronika and marie  three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home  then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being  unflinching   though why one should even feel like  flinching  once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can  t imagine  . the problem  however  is that the director is clearly convinced  and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics  that alexander  veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings  emotional capabilities . this latter idea  however  is arrant and offensive nonsense . there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular . but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work . it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated  miserable  and alone  or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter . watch  la maman et la putain  if you  re historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post     parisian milieu which was probably  unfortunately  not restricted to just a few particularly anti  social types like these . but please don  t make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have .

       " 'the movie is steeped in religion  so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it . in my opinion  this movie pretends to explore deep issues  but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices with little true insight . what the people in the movie  and therefore  the writer  failed to see was grace . they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds . to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful  and both the man  the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty  is just an oversimplification . such stereotypes really don  t exist  for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife  s pleasure before his own . scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh  and that no man ever hated his own flesh  but he nourishes and cherishes it . even if you want to ignore the new testament  the writers  characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament  and the even the book of proverbs which says   rejoice in the wife of thy youth  let her breasts satisfy you always   how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows  and approves of  and smiles on  the marital union and the enjoyment thereof  real men don  t ignore the value and needs of their wives . those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo  christian religion . god never said those things . it  s absurd . sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham . it didn  t need to be so . how sad . what sonia desperately needed was truth  not tradition . in knowing  loving and obeying god  we love others more before ourselves . that is the faith of the god of abraham  isaac  jacob  joseph once for all delivered to the saints bought  paid for by jesus christ  the righteous . but alright  ignore all this and abandon ancient  holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people  ghosts . that  s a good plan . i would never recommend this movie partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic  but also because it really doesn  t offer any valuable insight . check out  yentl  if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society .

       " 'zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement . the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement . the explosion that daria imagines  represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark  s death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself . the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life . during the    and     young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change . one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet  and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from . i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct . repression was the way to  control  social outbursts at that time and that is the method  police applies to stop the students . this society suffers from hipocresy  and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls . the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor  who  s detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested . presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom  the stealing of the plane represents mark  s inner wish for it but  his  going back or coming back or returning  segun   shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i  ve said  a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game . in my point of view a film to remember .

       " 'i hadn  t heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website  which made me curious . as a cartoonist and illustrator myself  i  m an admirer of richard williams  s work  i rate ziggy  s gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time  and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen  i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work  care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals  but it seems the man has his faults  most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule  and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super  talented individual like williams can go  given the right circumstances .  br    br   raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children  s cartoon . it tries also to be a musical . it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well  is it a freakout  is it a mind  blower  is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination   until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations . it  s beautifully animated  for the most part  though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention  but even that doesn  t count for much when you  re confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the  action  here .  br    br   there are a number of problems with the film  but let  s start with raggedy ann and andy themselves . they  re the stars of the show  yet they have no personalities . actually  we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy   i  m no girl  s toy   he sings  and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner  a little girl called marcella  carries her upside down  but that  s all we get to find out about these dull  as  mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after . i use the word  weirdness  advisedly  because some weird films can be hugely entertaining  but this is just flat  out strange . the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable  but they  re actually bizarre and disturbing . the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this . but even they  re relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain  whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll . yes  this is supposed to be a children  s film  then there  s the music  none of which is memorable  and all of which is sung by actors who can  t sing . and to add insult to injury  there  s a lot of singing in this film . when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom  the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are  about how they  ll always have each other and . . . yes  we get the message . this seems to go on forever  but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film . not for long  though  because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it  s made from worn and faded denim  and  bad enough that he  s clearly a paranoid schizophrenic  he also starts hallucinating . but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow . the greedy  a living  breathing . belching  farting  constantly eating pool of taffy  is so trippy  creepy and ultimately disturbing  you  ll hardly believe what you  re seeing  this is as close to a drug  free psychedelic experience as i  ve ever seen on film . then  after a l  o  n  g time spent with the greedy  along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo  whose throne resembles a urinal . i can  t believe i  m actually writing a capsule description of a real film here  i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i  m not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked  out nightmare i had . part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay  little nemo cartoons  for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it  probably . all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it  but there isn  t . these scenes are just strange  and very  very long . surrealism only works when there  s a strong idea behind it  or takes place against some semblance of reality . but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality . take away this element  and you  re left with pure self indulgence .  br    br   as the final scenes unravel  even the animation begins to look less impressive  the pirate ship  ludicrously detailed  jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production  and there  s a non  event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out . even at a meagre   minutes in length  the film feels like a never  ending ordeal  and it  s understandable why it flopped on its original release . animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly  but he did  and there  s nothing anyone can do about it .

       " 'my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer  today a writer and journalist  has put forward the theory that  just as british film  makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called  thatcher  s britain   the ealing comedies were intended as satires on  attlee  s britain   the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the     general election . this theory was presumably not intended to apply to  say   kind hearts and coronets   which is  if anything  a satire on the edwardian upper classes  or to  the ladykillers  or  the lavender hill mob   both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature . it can  however  be applied to most of the other films in the series  especially  passport to pimlico  .  br    br   pimlico is  or at least was in the forties  a predominantly working  class district of london  set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station . it is not quite correct to say  as has often been said  that the film is about pimlico  declaring itself independent  of britain . what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy . this means that  technically  pimlico is an independent state  and has been for nearly five hundred years  irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants . the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly  but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply .  br    br   because pimlico is not subject to british law  the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please  unhindered by the rationing laws . when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets  the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black  marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the  burgundians   as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves  to surrender .  br    br   many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system  either as an individual as happens in  the man in the white suit  or  the lavender hill mob   or as part of a larger community as happens in  whisky galore  or  the titfield thunderbolt  . the central theme of  passport  is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government  imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties . the film  s particular target is the rationing system . during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism  but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime . it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in      and organisations such as the british housewives  league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing . i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film  s satire were the  spivs   black marketeers   who play a relatively minor part in the action  or the housewives  league  who do not appear at all . the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats  who are portrayed either as having a  rules for rules  sake  mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all .  br    br   i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino .  indeed  i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film  . in      however  four years after the end of the war  the film  makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity  so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain . one of the best  known lines from the film is  we always were english and we always will be english and it  s just because we are english that we  re sticking up for our right to be burgundians  . there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense  tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico  all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics .  br    br   most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave  but in the last scene  after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain . global warming may have altered things slightly  but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief  whatever statistics might say to the contrary  that britain had an abnormally wet climate . the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important .  br    br   there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton  the grocer and small  time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico  and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor . in the main  however  this is  appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together  an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film . it lacks the ill  will and rancour of many more recent satirical films  but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that . it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and  with the possible exception of  kind hearts and coronets  is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies .

reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute  but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city . enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall  or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke . he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage  a predatory phantom of the night . camera shots from under taxi hoods  inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly

       " '  sky captain  may be considered an homage to comic books  pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres . one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences . i don  t think this is at all true . one  s expectations of the films  fiction and serials that  captain  pays tribute to were entirely different . especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children . this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those . of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama . toward the climax of  captain  law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal . they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with   seconds left to tragedy . of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency .  br    br   one doesn  t expect films like this to necessarily  make sense  . one does expect them to be fun  thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic .  captain  has almost none . remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge  well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side  they can fly    the chasm itself means nothing to them . the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape  if the land across the chasm is  forbidden  to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if .  br    br   i know that paltrow and law  both of whom have given fine performances in the past  were playing  types  but both were pretty flat . only giovanni ribisi  who showed himself capable of great nuance here  and angelina jolie seemed to give any  oomph  to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he  d only been given the chance . he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted .  br    br   the film had a great  look  but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts . cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical  when it is used to create creatures who don  t exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular . when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints . there is no real sense of wonder . a cgi mountain doesn  t have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does . i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn  t necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn  t it feel that way  it just didn  t .  br    br   as for the weak and clichd script . . . homage is no excuse . even so  had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable .  the last samurai  was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that  captain  didn  t most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that  sky captain  most definitely did not .  br    br   i  d like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the    s and    s . the original  jay garrick  flash or green lantern  alan scott  come to mind as being ripe for such treatment . maybe the better  more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film . it would be hard to be worse .

       " 'a few weeks ago the german broadcaster  sat   advertised this movie as the  tv  event of the year   sorry  but i  ve seen better things on tv this year .  br    br   i didn  t thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial  namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar the  heroine   if i can really call her that  in the middle and her two  loved  ones  next to her  pearl harbor  anyone  in fact the love  story is a poor man  s version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor   br    br   but as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish . the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return . now fast forward to spring      germany lost the war and the allies  russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies capitalism versus communism . well  i guess you already know the story because you have to know it  the movie doesn  t really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts . the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they  re trying to help .  br    br   what was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine  s mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like  that  s impossible   or when stalin  where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him  says that russia has to stop  coca cola  from spreading in germany . yeah right  if stalin has ever said something like this . or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it  please  burgers were invented way before that time .  br    br   in the movie you once see a map showing the airlines  funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer  in    . the us general lucius clay who  s main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner  the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects not enough african  american soldiers in the movie  there were like two in the whole film  also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would  ve been sent home . i don  t want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married  if it wasn  t for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire   br    br   if it wasn  t enough all americans in this movie spoke accent  free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months  look i  m also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent . notably bad was also the child acting  the kids had like two expressions on their faces  normal  i  look  monotonous  like  a  robot  and grinning .  br    br   all in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue . the sad part is that the movie was very successful   .   millions watched the first part and  .   millions the second part the day after thus sat  receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group . but like i always think the biggest pile of bull  crap is where the most flies go to .

       " 'i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it  s halloween  i was just at  knott  s scary farm  and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movie .  br    br   oh  and it only cost me one dollar .  br    br   usually i  ll ffwd through a movie like this to get to  the good stuff   but i resisted the urge here and i  m still not sure why . it was obvious from the opening shots this wasn  t a  real  movie  not even a b  movie . it  s more in the category of the decoteau  horror  movies like  the brotherhood  that are shot on film  look video for about   cents  in fact  i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something  . there were no cutaway shots  too expensive to do multiple camera setups  and flat lighting but . . . it  s hard to pinpoint . there  s something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half  decent movie . the fact that he  s doing even a half  decent job is commendable  and this movie has it  s share of merits   the acting isn  t bad  the photography is pretty good  if too bright to be scary   there are some surprises  and the whole thing is sort of . . . different somehow .  br    br   a bunch of college kids are  for some unknown reason  stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house . a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell . this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be  and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering . along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot   it  s interesting that this couple seems to be the most well  rounded in the movie . yes  there  s a sex scene but it isn  t salacious   or at least no more so than you  d find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex . it  s rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation .  br    br   the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the  stupid kids have sex and get killed  vibe of the    s slashers . it  s hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist  the genre has been done to death . i  m not sure if it  s good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre  without irony  as if it was still a living genre  but i appreciated the attempt .  br    br   which is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless  no  budget   a  for  effort  horror film . there really was too much set up  not enough gore  endless plot  holes  dead  ends and clichs and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned . . . but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool . i  d pay to go to that haunted house if it existed  and didn  t mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i  ll never watch this again .  br    br   oh  and possible spoiler  but there was great  brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin  i used to be claustrophobic . but i  ve changed .  ha ha  good one .

       " 'in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual  revolution   purposefully i use quotations for that word   jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic  damning critique of those who can  t seem to get enough love . if there is a message to this film  and i  d hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben  hur length feature has to offer  it  s that in order to love  honestly  there has to be some level of happiness  of real truth . is it possible to have two lovers  some can try  but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want  or feel they can even express to say what they want   br    br   what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre  jean  pierre leaud  has with the women around him  he  s a twenty  something pseudo  intellectual  not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman  marie  bernadette lafont  slightly older than him and is usually  if not always  his lover  his last possible love  of  his  life left him  and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street  veronika  franoise lebrun   who perhaps reminds him of her . soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film  where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures . at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre  but we  re mistaken . the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around  talking on and on  for something to sink in .  br    br   we  re told that part of the sexual revolution  in theory if not entirely in practice  perhaps it was  i can  t say having not been alive in the period to see it first  hand   was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions . but eustache  s point  if not entirely message  is that it  s practically impossible to have it both ways you can  t have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with  fing   as the characters refer over and over again .  br    br   the mother and the whore  s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity  the lack of monogamy  while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you  ve ever seen in a movie . at the same time we see a character like alexandre  who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it  s about some movie he saw or something bad from his past  eustache makes it so that the film itself isn  t pretentious  though it could appear to be  but that it  s about pretentiousness  what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws  what they need to use when they  re ultimately alone in the morning .  br    br   if you thought films like before sunrise  sunset were talky relationship flicks  you haven  t met this . but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have  sometimes trivial  or  deep   or sexual  or frank  or occasionally extremely  or in a subdued manner  emotional  it  s never  ever uninteresting or boring . on the contrary  for those who can  t get enough of a good talky film  it  s exceptional . while his style doesn  t call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand  eustache  s new  wave touch is with the characters  and then reverberating on them .  br    br   this is realism with a spike of attitude  with things at time scathing and sarcastic  crude and without shame in expression . all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can  t ever perceive them as  faking  an emotion or going at all into melodrama . it  s almost too good in naturalistic  realism terms  but for eustache  s material there is no other way around it . luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period  and both ladies  particularly labrun as the  whore  veronika  a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film  s climax of sorts in one unbroken shot  . and  as another touch  every so often  the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought  of a character sitting by themselves  listening to a record  and in contemplation or quiet agony . this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch  who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely  and lovingly  in approach from the late parisian .  br    br   sad to say  before i saw broken flowers  i never heard of eustache or this film  and procuring it has become quite a challenge  not available on us dvd  and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries  . not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work  one of the best of french relationship dramas  maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i  ve seen from the country in general . it  s complex  it  s sweet  it  s cold  it  s absorbing  and

       " 'while i have a great respect for disney  s animated films  as of late they haven  t really been what i would call  must  see  . atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer  and thankfully lived up to my expectations .  br    br   atlantis is a more  mature  disney film in the sense that it lacks songs  a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed   and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering . the world of atlantis  hidden beneath the earth  s core  is fantastic  presented as desolate caverns with ruins  and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems  which  while usually containing some reminder of harshness  become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached . the presentation of simply atlantis  landscape and setting  without some expendable cheery song  gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance . the inclusion of an atlantean language  as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real  life ancient civilizations adds to this  and works fairly well .  br    br   also  with the exception of some scenes involving mole  s practical jokes  there didn  t seem to be much of a  childish  element that i usually associate with disney films . instead  the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis  and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis  as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn  t know about . part of this involves the atlantean  weaponry   which is used in a very action  packed climax which is  for lack of a better word  quite exciting .  br    br   granted  not all of the story makes full sense  and the film doesn  t feature any amazing new computer  generated visual effects  but  aside from the toy story movies  this is the most entertaining disney film i  ve seen in years .

       " 'hal hartley  s henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work . it has immense character depth  subtle  complicated dialogue  and an excellent  emotional ending which captivates . i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling . henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish  and needed no sequel .  br    br   thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim . fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real  world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures . in her own movie  fay matures herself  though her maturity takes a very different road . simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat  introverted genius . fay starts her adult journey as an immature  utterly normal  spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature  utterly normal  experienced adult who holds no advantages . she deals with problems the way any human does  with determination  a little thought  and weary disdain . while simon learned to control his mind  fay learns to control her emotion .  br    br   the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel  but differs vastly in tone for most of the film . henry fool showed you a harsh  boring  ignorant world which contrasted with simon  s inner passion and creativity . in fay grim  the world is a lively  crazy  emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life  and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother .  br    br   the movie is in two parts  the first dealing with the beginning of fay  s struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility  and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry . at first  fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel  and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy . but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies . the sequel is about fay  s journey  and as i said before  hers is one of finding the life  giving sanity in chaos  not the creative chaos in staid order . parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley  s tongue in cheek humor perfectly . elina lwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role  allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively  stage  like comedy happening around her .  br    br   with the entrance of henry into the picture  the movie begins to take a sobering turn . hal hartley  s movies are all plays  and every play must come full circle . by the end  you are shown fay  s newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry  whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets .  br    br   fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool  but shows through hal  s range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius .  br    br   honestly  i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile  and especially the subtlety in parker posey  s acting   but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool .

       " 'a number of richard attenborough  s films as director have been biographies of major historical figures   young winston    gandhi    chaplin  .  grey owl  is also a filmed biography of a historical individual  but in this case attenborough  s subject is a much more obscure character .  br    br   grey owl was a canadian writer of the     s and     s who promoted the ideas of environmentalism and nature conservation at a time when these causes were less fashionable than they are today . he was widely believed to be an american indian the story he told about himself was that he had been born in mexico to a scottish father and apache mother and had emigrated to canada where he had been adopted as a member of the ojibway tribe . he lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the canadian wilderness  where he earned a living as a trapper . he toured britain twice  in     and      to promote his books and to give lectures on conservationism  and achieved great success  even being introduced to the royal family .  during one of these tours attenborough  then a teenager  saw grey owl at the london palladium theatre  . after his death in      however  it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be his real name was archibald belaney  and he had been born in the english seaside town of hastings .  br    br   the film departs somewhat from the facts of grey owl  s life . in a scene set in     he states that he is   years old in reality  he was born in     so would have been   in that year .    would have been pierce brosnan  s age when the film was made  so i am not sure why this change was made  . numerous events are compressed into the last four years of grey owl  s life            . in the film it is during this period that he meets and marries gertrude bernard whom he called anahareo in reality  he met and married gertrude as early as     . the film also omits the fact that they were divorced in     and that grey owl remarried shortly before his death .  br    br   the revelation of grey owl  s true identity adversely affected his posthumous reputation  and he was dismissed as a  fraud  . his supposed deceit was even used to discredit the causes which he had championed . richard attenborough  however  takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements . one of the themes explored by the film is the question of ethnic identity . although the erstwhile archibald belaney was not a canadian indian by birth  there is no doubt that he had a deep knowledge of ojibway culture and lore and that he spoke their language fluently . he was accepted by the ojibway as a member of their tribe . it therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a native north american identity as being a fraudulent one  merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born into .  br    br   according to the film  grey owl  s wife gertrude was herself of indian descent  but came from a family which had been assimilated into white canadian culture . her marriage can therefore be seen as her reclamation of her family  s original cultural heritage . she was clearly influenced by her husband  but she also had an influence on him  persuading him to give up his work as a fur trapper as she had moral objections to killing animals for their fur .  br    br   one criticism made of the film is that pierce brosnan is  miscast  as the hero  a criticism which seems to be rooted in the preconception that brosnan can only play action heroes in the james bond mould . it seems to me  however  that brosnan may deliberately have taken this role in order to avoid being typecast  the taciturn backwoodsman grey owl being about as far from the suave  sophisticated agent bond as one can get . the original bond  sean connery  also seems to have deliberately opted for contrasting roles when he appeared in films like  the hill  or  the molly maguires  . brosnan is in fact very good in this role  although i would agree with those who found annie galipeau weak as gertrude .  br    br   another frequently  voiced criticism with which i would not agree is that the film is  boring  . certainly  it is not an action film like the bonds  nor is it a great epic biopic like  gandhi   and it may indeed seem boring to those who were expecting it to be either the one or the other . it is however  likely to please anyone with an interest in the early days of the conservationist movement or the philosophical implications of national and ethnic identity . the scenes of the canadian forests are also beautifully photographed . richard attenborough has done us a service by helping to revive interest in this half  forgotten but fascinating figure .

       " 'what of domino did i hate over everything  and i mean everything  else  perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face . maybe it  s the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they  re uttered by people like kiera knightly who  if you buy as a bounty hunter  then you  ll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in     .  br    br   nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility  absolutely nobody at all . it is a painful and misguided experience  taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them . the principal question is  was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy   what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she  s coming across as  tough  but really  she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school  attempting to impress her peers . there are things you genuinely don  t know how to react to  whether they  re supposed to be funny or not . if it is supposed to be a comedy  that begs the next question  is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs   i don  t think so .  br    br   the film opens with the title card  based on a true story . . . . . . . . sort of .  if that  s supposed to be some sort of post  modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose  then you  re simply on another planet . truth is  in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying  sort of  which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer . following this  we learn of domino  s relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the  sort of  cop out as in real life she was just four . but if the film had gone by reality  s dates then her entire drive would  ve been born out of the death of . . . . . . . . her goldfish .  br    br   we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey  rourke   domino  knightley  herself and would  be love interest choco  ramrez  . during the scene  an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son  s life to be spared . what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers  fire off weapons at innocents we don  t know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs .  br    br   the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads  a feeling of  no  why are you doing this  why is this happening   bad seeds are planted and  wouldn  t you know it  they stick . the film is painful to watch  excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills      . here is another daft post  modernist slant  people playing themselves and that  sort of  joker card being played again . christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr  s natural born killers character .  br    br   so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco  s gang  purely for her good looks i might add  it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver  s registration i . ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another . the problem is  as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isn  t a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place  does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up  if there is any  feeling  between choco and domino  it exists on such a small  tiny  minimalist scale that you have to ask why it  s even included .  br    br   so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative  wise . we find out the reason for the fake i . ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble . the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded  he must  ve swam really quickly  double the speed of the film  s fasted edit which means something in the region of .   of a second . yeah  sure . the film  s story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up . plus  there  s a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film  s comedy runs so dry  that it has to resort to the  jerry  jerry   chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show . when did we last laugh at  jerry  jerry    when we were  say  seven years old  i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film  s existence .

       " '    spoilers      br    br   before i begin this  let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the  authorized version  of this movie  remade by stephen king  himself  in     .  br    br   both advantages made me appreciate this version of  the shining   all the more .  br    br   also  let me say that i  ve read mr . king  s book   the shining  on many occasions over the years  and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work  stanley kubrick  s retelling of this story is far more compelling . . . and scary .  br    br   kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film . in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay  itself  he acquired the title  magus  beyond question . kubrick  s genius is like magic . the movie world lost a great director when he died in     . among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut       full metal jacket       barry lyndon       a clockwork orange            a space odyssey       spartacus      and many more .  br    br   the torrences  jack  wendy his wife and danny  their son  are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker . it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow  until spring when the overlook reopens its doors . it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow  filled summer getaway .  br    br   the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . it lent to the atmosphere  by having a dark  yet at the same time  welcoming  atmosphere  itself . the furnishings and furniture was all period  late    s  early    s   and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant . it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world .  br    br   the introduction of wendy and danny  s characters was a stroke of genius . you get the whole story of their past  danny  s  imaginary friend   tony  and the story of jack  s alcoholism all rolled into this nice  neat introductory scene . there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously  kubrick saw that from the beginning .  br    br   closing day . again  the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel  this time  with family in tow   the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange .  br    br   the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking  even as the  staff  is moving things out  you get a chance to see the majestic fire places  the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings  dormants and crown moldings in the architecture .  they did a good job  pink and gold are my favorite colors .   wendy torrence  even the  staff wing  is well designed and beautifully built .  br    br   the maze was a magnificent touch  reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian . when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center  seeing wendy and danny entering  it  s a magickal moment one that tells you right away  there are heavy energies in that house there  s something seriously wrong  already starting .  i wouldn  t want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out .   the hotel manager   br    br   scatman cruthers  as dick halloran  was genuine and open in his performance . his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful . you could actually believe you were there in the hotel  taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and  doc .  his explanation of  the shining  to danny was very well delivered  as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel . it was believable and sincere .  br    br   the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself  with the mountains looming behind  the cold air swirling about  mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel  adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie . it also marks the  half  way  to  hell  point  so to speak the turning point in the movie .  br    br   shelley duvall  s portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful .  so what if she also played olive oyl   it just shows her marvelous diversity   honestly  before i saw the movie on the big screen in      i said   what  olive oyl  lol  popeye was also released in     .  but i took that back as soon as the movie started . she  s brilliant . in this fiend  s opinion  this is her best performance  to date   although i did love her in steve martin  s  roxanne       .   br    br   once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you  the viewer  need to be in possession the torrence  s past danny  s broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not  mental   but rather clairvoyant instead  and the general layout of the hotel all of which you get in the opening  sequences the movie never stops scaring you .  br    br   the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker  delbert grady  the girls having appeared several times to danny  first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel  were icons with which danny could identify  and of which he was afraid  at the same time . they were haunting  and haunted   themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed  in a rather graphic and material way .  br    br   kubrick  s tony was written as an attendant spirit  like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . he was . . .  the little boy who lives in my mouth .  he would manifest in the end of danny  s finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny . not like in the book  i realize  where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy  trying to save his father . kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony  took . . . danny . . . over .  the idea of danny  s older self projecting back to his younger self isn  t . . . scary .  br    br   the  woman in the shower  scene  done by lia beldan  about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before  or since  as the younger woman and billie gibson  who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since   was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting . it was dramatic  and frightening . abhorrent and scary . when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real .  br    br   jack quickly embarks on his trek from the  jonesing  alcoholic to a certifiable insane person . the degradation of his character  s mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick . jack  s instant friendship with lloyd the bartender  as only alcoholics  would  be mental patients and drug addicts do  portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him namely  alcohol . . .  hair of the dog that bit me .   jack torrence  in jack  s case  it  s bourbon on the rocks  at no charge to jack .  orders from the house .   lloyd the bartender  nice play on words .  br    br   when wendy find  s jack  s  screenplay  is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over  albeit in  or  different creative styles . . . when he asks from the shadows   how do you like it   and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand . . . is so poignant . it  s the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up jack is . it  s very scary  dramatic and delivers a strong presence . that coupled with danny  s visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood  imposed over the scene between jack and wendy  and with the confrontational ending to this scene  make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie .  br    br   the  redrum  scene . wow . what do i say  what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young  troubled son standing over them with a huge knife  talking in that freaky little voice  exclaiming  redrum  over and over  even if it had no meaning  it would still be as scary as the  th level of hell . it was something everyone could  and has  remember  ed  . speaking of memorable scenes . . .  br    br   nicholson  s final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . his ad  libbed line   heeeeere  s johnny   was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . it also goes down in horror movie history .  br    br   the ending . .  kubrick  s ending was perfection . i felt it ended beautifully . no smarm  no platitudinous whining  no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie . just epitomized perfection . that  s all i  ll say on the subject of the ending .  br    br   who cares what was taken out   look what kubrick put in . rent it  watch it  buy it . it  s a classic in the horror genre  and for good reason . it rawks    br    br   me being me . . . take this movie  and sitck it in your stephen king

       " 'the power of kangwon province is director hong sang  soo  s second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film  including the multiple connected narratives  in this case  two   and stories of troubled or troubling relationships  as well as a potent dosage of irony .  br    br   one thing that  s clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism . however  this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein . the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends  only to find herself drawn to a stranger  the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes .  br    br   again  hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don  t think he  s entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters  drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony . i think the think i  ve come to love about hong  s films is that they just feel so real  especially the complex and conflicted characters . not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings  but rather  that these characters he and the actors present  feel fully developed and believable .  br    br   this is not a fast moving film . there  s a lot of lingering and like the previous film  things don  t always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways . there doesn  t appear to be any element of the film that isn  t intentionally placed in the film and it  s made my a little hyper  aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses .  br    br   power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion  regret  longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision  making . it  s a rather hard balance to keep and it  s surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row . technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear . this film doesn  t pack the same emotional wallop that the first does  but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision . great viewing for art cinema lovers .     .

       " 'david mackenzie  s follow  up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel  good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho  sexual issues with his dead mother . it wants to be gritty  realistic  and mysterious . at the same time  it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult .  br    br   to meet this end  the film tries hard to be youthful . its poster has hand  drawn letters looking like that of juno . its original soundtrack is comprised of fast  paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok just a little misguided . but strangely the film is anything but youthful .  br    br   like young adam this film  s central mystery concerns a drowned woman  in this case hallam  s mother . young adam keeps its mystery quiet  contemplative  and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come . hallam foe does the opposite . it foregrounds its character  s psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters . the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend . hallam swiftly interrupts  asserting his presence in the household . here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie .  br    br   the mystery surrounding his mother  s drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father  s girlfriend . the audience can never really trust hallam because  besides being creepy  we think his obsession has led him close to insanity . this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable . right when he  s found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home  at first it appearing to be looking for the police . then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother  which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element .  br    br   while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character  he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs . this movie is in no way mysterious  yet it is not blunt either . it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues  but it adds a very self  conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite . it goes for a soundtrack  heavy  trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings  picks locks  and camps out for the sake of voyeurism . these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward  drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy  giddy  or pleasant . they are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story . mackenzie makes you understand hallam  yet he fails to build common ground .  br    br   he expects you to enjoy hallam  s trials and tribulations without much ideological justification . the film hinges on its audience  s perspective on voyeurism  the kind of person who engages in it . obviously  most people would be disgusted by it . and hallam foe realizes that  but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions . he goes from person to person  trying to fill his deep void . there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam  s love interest kate where she drunkenly says  i love creepy boys   perhaps asking the audience to do the same . the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him  her motivation remains vague throughout  and tries to further us from judging him . it  s not hard to like hallam  but it is very hard to participate in his adventure  if it is even an adventure at all . all the while  the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood .  br    br   great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act  muddy development  and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie . recently this film was re  named for a us release  and for what reason  not only is it more unappealing  but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title  mister .

       " 'after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd . that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true . for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all . the list of problems with the film could drag on forever . chief amongst them is the film is simply too long . it dragged on for a few minutes short of  hours . nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly .  br    br   secondly  as many had pointed out from the  trailers   the special effects are anything but special . the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade  z      s or      s quality . probably the worst effects of all were the horses  which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved . the heat ray effects were laughable  as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles . also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence  in which the thunderchild  described in the book as an ironclad ram  looked nothing of the sort . instead it resembled a world war  era destroyer  complete with deck guns  which fired but had no visible crew   and torpedo tubes .  br    br   the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects . most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky . well  the sky is black  but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight . there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape  bathed in full sunlight  and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars . to detract even further  the color of the scenes made no sense . in some they are bathed in orange light . in others green light . in still others it  s blue light . in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue . the frame  rate and camera is very shaky  giving everything a stuttering look .  br    br   finally  the acting is overall sub  par . one man portrays two characters who  s sole difference was one lacked a mustache . this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were . the english accents  even to american ears  are outrageous .  br    br   in summary  this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times . i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one  because of it  s poor quality in every respect  must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out . i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom   or   in the imdb rankings . it  s a pity that mystery science theater is not still around .

       " 'don  t get me wrong .  goldeneye  was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the    franchise . but the series had fallen into a fps rut . enter  everything or nothing   which puts bond in third  person . when i wrote my earlier review for  from russia with love   i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly . even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise  eon definitely is superior in terms of in  depth controls and gameplay variety . missions range from standard running  and  gunning to driving an suv  driving an aston martin  driving a limousine that is wired to explode  commandeering two different types of tanks a la  goldeneye   riding a motorcycle  flying a helicopter  repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires  and free falling after a plummeting damsel . sure  vehicle controls are a little clumsy  but the issue here is the variety .  br    br   as movie adaptations   goldeneye  and frwl were all that i could have hoped for . but eon  s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure . this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe  shannon elizabeth  heidi klum  and misaki ito . judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q  respectively  and pierce brosnan  while no sean connery  adds credibility to the game  s proceedings . all characters resemble the stars  with the disappointing exception of heidi klum  who  s in  game model doesn  t do the real  life model justice . mya  s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes .  br    br   the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies . willem defoe  s character is a former colleague of christopher walken  s baddie from  a view to a kill  . richard kiel appears as jaws  the hulking henchman from  the spy who loved me  and  moonraker  in three fight scenes  the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have .  br    br   single  player gameplay mainly consists of standard on  foot missions as bond . like bond  you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing . the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth  with plenty of wall and object cover . unfortunately  unlike frwl  only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging  so bond may end up crouching low when he  s supposed to be peeking around a corner  and vice  versa . the game also allows players to go into  bond reflex  mode . while you browse your inventory  everything around you will go into super slo  mo  allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with . while this takes some getting used to  eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular  bond moments   such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath  and greatly add to the bond movie feeling .  br    br   there are  available difficulty levels operative  agent  and double oh . on operative  you can breeze through in a few hours . on agent  a few weeks . on double oh  a few months . the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission . garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear . some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints  but when all is said and done  no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie .  br    br   multi  player  unfortunately  is not as thrilling .  goldeneye  still has the best multi  player mode of any bond game . eon  s main multi  player is a co  op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi  agents on a less important mission than bond  s . a more standard third  person death match can be unlocked from this mode . but the single  player mode is the most complete bond experience to date . the ending  as with most bond games  is anticlimactic . while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game  the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing . also  levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error . still  for any serious bond fan  not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films .

       " 'this     film was based on a script by the late edward d . wood  a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief . while much of wood  s work was quirky low  budget entries into various genre  film traditions  his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant  garde techniques . i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood  the experimenter  although this film is a comedy  a nightmarish comedy  however    while the cross  dressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there . from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world  and i can  t really compare that world with anything else . the technical side of the film   production design  sound design  music scoring  photography  etc .   is groundbreaking on any number of levels . in particular  although the film has no  dialogue  there is sound of all kinds and also  language   but you  ll have to see how it  s done yourself  as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout . the glen or glenda  esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum . the whole film is played at a hysterical fever  pitch  and billy zane provides an amazing tour  de  force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is . in a just world  he would have been given some award for this performance . he even looks like ed wood  and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny  sleazy  tragic  sympathetic  and anonymous  sometimes simultaneously     . what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release  only playing a few festivals . right now  it  s only available on video in germany  in fact  my copy is from a german source   the excerpts from wood  s screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german  although the newspaper headlines  that great low  budget technique of giving plot elements  especially those that would be too expensive to film  via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood tradition  that zane sees are in english  . i think that this film could have gotten a word  of  mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion . and if played off city by city slowing on the art  film circuit  it could have done well . in fact  if the legal issues can be resolved  i  d like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release  especially a midnight  cult  release . this is a classic waiting to be discovered .  br    br   did i  understand  every scene  no  but i  felt  every scene emotionally . did everything  work  in the film  perhaps not . i  ve only seen it twice  and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times . however  with all the assembly  line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much  alternative  film being fetishistic or pretentious shot  on  video film  school rejects  we need actual hollywood  made experimentation like this . the recent bob dylan film  masked and anonymous  took similar chances as did something like steven soderbergh  s full frontal . this film could find an audience much larger than either of those . if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing  see if it has ever been released on video . you will not be bored . invite some friends over . . . make it a party . play the amazing soundtrack loud . i have a feeling that  wherever he is in the afterlife  ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film . wood  s probably also laughing that  just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life  the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making .

       " 'i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally . as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema . i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book  film   which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re  read today . my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin  drifters  grierson  s magnificent documentary   metropolis  the cabinet of dr caligari  and ecstasy came first through this book and later at my university art  house cinema . ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican  for condoning eva  s desertion of emil  her subsequent divorce  and the brief swim she took in the buff  but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant  outstandingly beautiful  visual paean to love  a view echoed by many imdb users . a very lonely young man  when i saw it  i willingly concurred . no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos  by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed . quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial . ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence  against which individual lives are insignificant  perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term  the lifeforce  .  br    br   ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong . disappointed  she returns home and divorces him . soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding . she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience . her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing . but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself . after these exciting climacteric sequences  a bland  predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy  collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy . this story is trite  the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage  as did most of its contemporaries  long ago . what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography  a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction  coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important  it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film . it is sub  titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub  titles  and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward . this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch . the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it . for example  the names  eva and adam the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery  a bee pollinating a flower  a key entering a lock  a breaking necklace during eva  s virginal lovemaking sequence with adam  etc .   and the final post  suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society  as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on .  br    br   as a     film i would rate this at   even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below  . for me the film will always remain a  must see    although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment  . unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme      s reaction to hedy kiesler  s very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood  some critics  who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites  hula  back to god  s country  bird of paradise or some of the early works of d . w . griffiths and c . b . demille  have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film  . this scene was probably part of the original novel  and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it .  br    br   two further thoughts firstly this is a czech film  released there in     . its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations  i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film  were they removed from the copy i saw then   . secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime . we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience .

       " 'first of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic gregory  s girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated . while it  s true that sequels are usually  bar a few notable exceptions  a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense . in the case of gregory  s two girls  bill forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins  on the one hand revisiting the plot of gregory  s girl  while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers . schoolboy gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen  he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy . although now thirty five  gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances  also sixteen  despite the fact that music teacher  bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him . his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend . there  s no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all . the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself  in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who actively and comically pursues dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over . at thirty five  gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic . outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices . as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished  save two pointless scenes with his younger sister  who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life  we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants  who he is and why he is the way he is . why for example is he friendless  why does he never see his father  who is clearly still alive  why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended  why is he so interested in noam chomsky and injustice  why has he become so apathetic  why is he attracted to frances  why isn  t he attracted to bel until the last twenty minutes of the film  what in heaven  s name do bel or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting  why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life  are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school  kids  does gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything  to make matters worse  actor john gordon sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language . unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy . on top of that  it  s hard to feel any sympathy for  or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats . rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia . it  s hard to know what was going through bill forsyth  s head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm  wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic . i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all . that at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent . as it is gregory  s two girls adds up    wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less . gregory  s girl was responsible for launching bill forsyth  s career  here  s hoping that gregory  s two girls won  t be responsible for sinking it .

       " 'in august     the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .  br    br   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no  one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain  s trial was over before it began .  br    br   lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .  br    br   fred schepisi  s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson  s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .  br    br   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co  written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .  br    br   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity . his  as was streep  s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia  s finest actors and actresses playing a part .  br    br   technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock  . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .  br    br   for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said   i don  t think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people .   br    br   saturday  may         video  br    br   even on return viewings fred schepisi  s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in      is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .  br    br   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson  s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .  br    br   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .  br    br   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn  t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .  br    br   editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker  s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton  s music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians .  br    br   sunday  june         video  ',\n",
       " '  five days  is billed as something special  a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes  each set on one particular day of a police enquiry . but in fact  this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought  as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to   hours is hardly noticeable  and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories . in fact one almost can  t help drawing comparisons to the last  prime suspect   as one of the sub  plots focuses on a single  cynical female cop approaching retirement and it  s not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable . there  s a lot of earnest over  emoting  manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic  in another suspicious . and it  s possible to guess the guilty party well before the end  not because of the internal dynamic of the story  but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true  to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times . in spite of these failings  the series grew on me by the end  i was quite gripped . but it  s a sad sign that the bbc  which once made the likes of  the singing detective   boasted of this of  possibly the best drama of the year   for there  s little true originality on offer here  and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing .  five days  is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic  and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh .

       " 'i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it . it is not a strictly biographical film it is  loosely based  on the facts . but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness  and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr . petiot .  br    br   there are many memorable images in this movie petiot traveling through the night like a vampire  his black cloak flapping behind him  is almost iconic . there are also several touches of expressionism  petiot  s crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation  reminds me of some scenes from  nosferatu  .  br    br   but i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural . the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds  starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits  accompanied by wordless wailing . petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops  and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere  as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw . there are animal noises as well  the concierge keeps a goat  unseen cats howl  and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass . the whole atmosphere is unsettling  with overtones of violence and slaughter .  br    br   not only animals  but human voices are often heard  the screams of gestapo victims  petiot  s patients in his waiting room  monitored by a listening device  just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells . even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them  when petiot goes to see mme kern  we hear her singing as she works  her voice echoing in the theater  before we ever see her . and even when she does appear  she is often filmed from behind  her voice calling out to her husband  whose voice calls out to her in conversation . disembodied voices echo in large halls  and their owners  when seen at all  are photographed at a distance  so we cannot actually see them speaking . this is a ghost story  and these are the voices of ghosts  many of them petiot  s future victims .  br    br   yet petiot himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera  throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody . in a way  he is as much a ghost as those he murders . he is always frantically busy  scurrying from appointment to appointment  never at rest . but his activity is that of a machine  lifeless and imperturbable . it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris  petiot alone is unafraid he is amused  enthusiastic  angry  irritated  contemptuous  but never afraid  unlike those real people he lures to their deaths . it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions  including a perpetual motion machine  a true detail from the book  he did claim to have invented many machines   he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself . and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film  from the opening giant wheel in the movie house  to petiot  s bicycle  with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives   to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill . even his routine with his victims is mechanical  write a note to your wife  let me disguise you before you leave  you need a vaccination  barcelona  casablanca  dakar  like a well  oiled machine  the routine is always the same  just as the record is always the same .  br    br   maeder  the author  says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial . his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp  and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiot  s involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis . unfortunately  it doesn  t quite work as part of the story  because it  s very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators  or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night . disposing of bodies  hiding stolen goods  it  s hard to say  and harder to believe it  s not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiot .  br    br   but it does remind us of the duality of evil people petiot is a robber and a murderer  but he is also a devoted father and husband . just as we learned that hitler loved dogs  and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men  so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally . his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing  robbing and disappearing are happening all around  nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile .

       " 'an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans  it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face  namely that we  ll all be dead in a few hundred years  which is already indisputable  but who cares  humans are selfish  destructive creatures  i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction . i  ll just call it a  natural progression  . let the apocalypse begin  but meanwhile  we have to listen to the same brazen  slanted politicians who propose another  new society   well  don  t be fooled  we  ll all still be controlled by the wealthy  by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place . nothing will ever change .  br    br   al gore  whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film  as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer  he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion  the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle  tobacco  pig farming  which accounts for methane gas traces  and who knows what else  his wealth is predicated on exploitation  greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records . i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate  but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party  that is all  meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling . this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he  s lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques  he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets  uses product placed computers in the documentary  and yet he thinks everything is a  moral issue  . he  s entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares  he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister  from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things  . did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines  no . everything must serve the  economy   so why is he any different  the answer is he is not .  br    br   his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous  all this while he  s being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes . well mr gore  why don  t you try living like the common people then  he is a politician  plain and simple  he has a career invested in the power structure . my question is  why doesn  t he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications  he doesn  t do that because it would be unwise for  investments  stocks and corporations  .  br    br   al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary  namely to wealthy white people in the audience  who clap on cue  while showing them graph charts  numbers and percentages  and speaking in a dreary tone  no one without a harvard  which the elites control  education can make sense out of it  but he tells us everything is going to hell . no kidding  but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet  namely that it is expendable and a waste dump . he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems  he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system . its obvious he was spoiled  sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing  inconsistent dullard in washington . whoever made this propaganda  as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived  had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse . that is to say  someone is going to benefit  and it seems the  new green  politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the  new utopian future  with  new technologies  . it  s the same old story  al gore is a believer in the elitist structure  he actually believes there is a  democracy  in the us which i find very naive . if we aren  t paying wages to the oil companies  then we  ll be paying them to the wind and solar companies .  br    br   i find the speech at the end quite rancid  along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses  gore speaks about  people uniting together to defeat communism  in the      s  what it had to do with global warming  absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people . with that said  he didn  t understand that communism never existed in the world  the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism  no less different than what controls the us interests . social ecology was not even mentioned here  which is really a travesty . if you want to change the world  then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed  exploitation and violence .

       " 'wow  the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses   years ago . i  ll preface by saying i  m not a fan of narrated episodes . if the story  actors  etc . are worth their salt  they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out  reminded me of personages who can  t think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters . the psychobabble was tedious and boring  but some enjoy that kind of thing  it  s just not my cup o tea . they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something . niggling little things like peugeot being at the house  which has a singular half circle driveway  yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under  because it  s nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . sloppy editing  as she pulls into the driveway  for what seems the    th time  exactly who are those  guys you see at   m   s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house  the dolly close  ups were also overdone  like some jr . high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time . i could keep picking apart  but that might get almost as boring as this episode was . it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of elaine driving the newport convertible . i fully expected to see the chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the  track player  automatic top etc . the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just ends  abruptly . no loose ends tied up  nothing explained or terminated . not that many would notice  i suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end .

       " 'horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies . i  m not very fond of them myself  but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema . the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibus  featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent .  br    br   this film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema peter cushing  christopher lee and ingrid pitt  whom horror fans will recognise as one of lee  s co  stars in the greatest british horror film of all time the wicker man .  br    br   the first segment of the film  titled  method for murder  tells the story of a horror storywriter  whose creation a strangler named  dominic  is brought to life by his own imagination . this story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend  he  and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination . this story certainly isn  t very original  but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it  s final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise .  br    br   the second story  titled  waxworks   stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four . this tale follows the story of phillip grayson  cushing   a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in . inside  he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess . quite what the woman  s relationship with phillip entailed is never really explained  but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details . cushing is later joined by his friend  neville rogers  played by joss ackland  and that  s when the tale really starts to pick up . the setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn  t a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent     horror film   chamber of horrors  . although the one here isn  t as grand as the one in the aforementioned film  the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect  much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia  brought about by the limited area of the museum . peter cushing is always interesting to watch  and seeing him avoid an axe  wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan . despite being my least favourite  this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down .  br    br   the film continues with  sweets for the sweet   which is without doubt the best of the omnibus . this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly overprotective father . the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out . it leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter  but we don  t know who  or what  it is . christopher lee  as usual  portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll  and the fact that she isn  t allowed to go to school or have any toys . the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end  epitomised by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is  in fact  afraid of his daughter . the ending to this section is superbly played out  in my opinion it  s one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told  and will stay with you long after the end credits roll .  br    br   the omnibus finishes with  the cloak   which is definitely the most comedic of the four . this tale is about a hammy horror film star that  unimpressed by his latest film  s technical side  goes out and buys himself a cloak . naturally  this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak . unlike the other three tales  this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs . that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film . the ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film  which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film . also  look out for the little jibe regarding christopher lee in dracula . a nice touch  i think .  br    br   overall  if you want a horror omnibus  you really cant go wrong with the house that dripped blood . the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed .

       " 'michael curtiz directed this     very  stylish whodunit from a script by robert presnell sr .  robert n . lee and peter mine . the original novel they adapted was  the kennel murder case   perhaps from a writer  s standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s . s . van dine . vance was a long  worded and superior detective genius  and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less  engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers . fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character .  later he was played by basil rathbone  warren william  and paul lukas before being consigned to  b  picture status . the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law  with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers . this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered  and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex . the characters are unarguably unusually well  realized  the direction rather good and unusually swift  paced and except for a darkish b  w look  the film avoids the comedic asides  superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries . jack okey did the good art direction . the music by berhard kaun is serviceable orry  kelly did the costumes . william reese provided the mostly  indoor cinematography . in the interesting cast  powell is the philo vance of his time  mostly sober  minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there . eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to vance  with his very professional timing . the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul cavangh  very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part . mary astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved . also in the cast were helen vinson as the villain  s woman  jack la rue  ralph morgan  best known as frank morgan  s brother   robert barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill  archer coe  and frank conroy as his likable brother with robert mcwade as the d . a .  quirky and funny etiienne girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene . james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent . the story breaks into four parts . first there is shad doings at a dog show  where vance  coe and cavanagh are all showing west highland terriers . cavanagh  s dog is killed  by coe  to prevent him winning the title over his own entry . the second portion of the scene involves a leave  taking someone is confused enough by who has gone where  after coe parts from his girl friend  vinson  to murder his nice brother by mistake . enter vance  to find out who did in archer coe in a locked room and how  with the help of palette the romantic difficulties are straightened out  the chinese servant is exonerated  we find out who broke the expensive vase  who will marry whom  how archer coe was done in and why the butler did not do it   but someone else with a good excuse did . this is a more  than  good little mystery  which skilled hungarian  born director curtiz took quite seriously . he used wipes  swift cuts  changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera  work to achieve variety  interest and a sustained pace . many writers  critics and experts  myself included  consider this to be the best of the vance projects  although others are estimable as well .

       " '  like the first touch of pleasure and guilt  like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear  like a climax of contrary emotions  said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top  the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville  s le mouton enrage .  br    br   vincent canby in new york times  however  just after the     premiere of the movie stated  love at the top which opened yesterday at the   th street playhouse  is a     french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen  fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition .  yet  the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system . . .  january          br    br   having left the evaluations up to single individuals  of course  the test of time has done its just job . what may be said with certainty after more than   years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent  where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic  where feelings occur so manipulative .  br    br   for romy schneider  s fans  it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see  not only because she gives a unique performance  as she did in all of her roles  at the heyday of her career   years before her sudden death  but because she is particularly attractive here . it is not trio infernal where the  so to say   forced escape  from and the mockery of romy  s sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation  but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role . she plays roberte  a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story  s lead  playboy nicolas mallet  jean louis trintignant  . it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons . this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes . romy  s sex appeal is unforgettable here .  br    br   another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception . immoral as it may seem  the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures  innocence vs decadence  genuine lust vs instrumental affair . nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest  may find attractive or disgusting yet  his are the features the viewers must treat seriously  more to say  they are the ones we all must accept . that is why  one is led to a peculiar  gently wild  erotically unique world of the main character . although he sleeps with lots of women  there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola roberte groult  romy schneider  and marie  paul  jane birkin  . he manipulates them  makes love to them  cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet  he perceives them differently . yet  despite all of this  adult maturity   he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy  car on the table  a sort of  detailed insight into male mind . . .  in a comedy  like way  of course .  br    br   finally  there are very good performances  which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated . not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role  but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young  inexperienced streetwalker marie paul  jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way . this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint  sans  the tune that will ring in your ears for long . therefore  apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors  slow action  sometimes   possible clichs  noticed by some viewers   the merits should be found significant .  br    br   le mouton enrage  in sum  is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life . it is worth seeing as a moment in romy  s career  a prelude to strong eroticism  a chain of contrary emotions  of love and hatred  appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm . . . but aren  t we  humans   viewers   movie buffs built upon such contrasts   ',\n",

       " 'well  first off  if you  re checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead        type film  forget it . this is about  zombies  in a more psychological sense  where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will  but who must instead follow the will of another . the  zombies  here  as little as they are in the film  are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general  as in wartime . it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film .  br    br   the film is set during world war i . a  french cambodian  contingent had heard strange stories about zombification   supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies   and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes . armand louque  dean jagger  brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification  but he won  t talk . so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to  wipe out the white race  .  br    br   one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer  director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script . the film begins as if it will explore the zombie  military metaphor  and maybe even have adventure elements  but after about   minutes  it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story .  br    br   halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power  and a nietzschean  will to power   . the film is interesting on that level  but the script and the editing are very choppy . this is yet another older film for which i wouldn  t be surprised if there is missing footage  especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue .  br    br   amidst the contrived romance story  halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread  but little of the zombie material makes much sense . louque discovers the secret of zombification  but it doesn  t mean much to the viewer . the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusinghalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi  s googly  eyes from his     film  white zombie  but never explains what it has to do with anything . there are big gaps in the plot  including the love story . promising  interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time . one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much .  br    br   if you  re a big fan of old  creaky b movies  revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once   the acting isn  t all that bad  and if you  ve got a good imagination  you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps . but this is the second time i  ve seen the film  with the first only being about five years ago  and i could barely recall anything about it   so it  s not exactly memorable .

       " 'jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires . in that case  it wasn  t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn  t be ignored . i  m reminded of the episode of michael moore  s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . the results were not very promising  so it  s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .  br    br   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film  . bruce is nearly   years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that  s seeking to bake the world  s biggest cookie . he  s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .  br    br   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman  s massive talent as an actor . he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .  br    br   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer  s religion . i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . but despite the fact that i don  t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .  br    br   jim carrey  s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he  s come . if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it  s amazing how far he  s come . he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever  . jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .  br    br   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side  splitting office space  as bruce  s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce  s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . there is definitely some low  brow comedy in the film that doesn  t really fit with the importance of the film  s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura  s friend spike make a cameo appearance . as stephen king very well knows  it  s always nice to see familiar characters . it  s almost like seeing family again .  br    br   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers . the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more .  br    br   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce  s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery  s cooking . the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he  s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother  in  law .  br    br   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection . it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low  brow humor to keep the kids entertained . this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it  s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . don  t miss this one .

       " 'skullduggery is a strange  strange film based on the novel  ye shall know them  by vercors . to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind  since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity  and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance . but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well  meaning tone  skullduggery simply isn  t a very good film . for me  the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can  t make its mind up how best to convey its message . the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci  fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics . the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great  too jarring  to overlook . they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you  re watching a muddled  disorganised movie .  br    br   an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple  burt reynolds  . one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame  susan clark  . after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape  like creatures . these primitive  long  lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man . there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the  missing link  in the evolution of apes into humans . or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual  or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics  the archaeologists call the tribe  the tropi  and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery . but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen  paul hubschmid  declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers . he questions whether the tropi are truly  human  and takes his argument to the courts  where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued .  br    br   this was a very early film in reynolds  career  and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he  s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously . not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role  asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick . his character and the film are not relevant to each other . clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist  and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox  alexander knox and wilfrid hyde  white . a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make  up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance . rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids  the stuck  on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical . and that  s just not the right idea . we  re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures  but that  s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing . skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant  philosophical and stimulating . the honourable intentions are there for all to see  but the end result doesn  t do them justice . a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless .

       " 'i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together  the talk is not of the master  s great films like  north by northwest  or  strangers on a train   but a lesser  known effort like this one from      obscure and seriously flawed  which showcases the great director in fledgling form .  br    br   emily and fred hill  joan barry and harry kendall  are a middle  class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun .  br    br   just ask richard hannay  roger o . thornhill  or marion crane . well  marion  s indisposed at the moment  but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight  setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock  s earliest foray into this theme  and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense  but the two do not cohere  at least not here .  br    br   the hills are a dull  flat couple  with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies bergre  in the form of cross  cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers .  the curtain  s gone up too soon   gasps emily .  they aren  t dressed .   br    br   when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing  even if the people they partner off with are drips  too . emily  s man  gordon  percy marmont  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs  which he suggests be filled by emily . fred  s girl  the princess   betty amann  has clara bow  s eyes and wallace beery  s five o  clock shadow . there  s also an obnoxious fellow passenger  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come .  br    br   everything is shot in an abrupt manner  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn  t come off  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged  together rickshaws  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism .  br    br   emily  s the only vaguely sympathetic character  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon  but mostly because she  s among the first of hitchcock  s many magnetic blondes  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film  s conclusion .  br    br   matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set  piece for the protagonists to come to grips with  and presumably repair their relationship . only they aren  t active participants in the resolution  and except for the fate of a friendly cat  nothing about the ending resonates .  br    br   at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early     s  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food .  rich and strange  is hitchcock paying his dues  and learning his trade  one for scholars but not casual film goers .

highly entertaining  and . . . taken in the right context as a work of fiction  it is a very good movie . for that  i give it the two stars .  br    br   however  rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere  i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth . i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character  dr . nicholas garrigan  is a complete invention of fiction . rather  it presents this character into a real historical setting  and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real  and what they are seeing is the truth . i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction  but to do so in such a dishonest matter is  in a word  reprehensible .  br    br   there can be no doubt that africa  along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering . hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film . but hollywood also has its eye toward making money . the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself  or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary .  br    br   but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much . at the end of the day  they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself  and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming   see  we told you it was bad   the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie . arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin  idi  s second wife  whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity . in the film  we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse  arms for legs and vice  versa  . this is the director making sure you understand that amin is  as the gungans say  bom  bad  but watching the documentary  we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth  which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true .  br    br   so . . . what . . . they just make up these things  why  because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence  that  s why  they don  t trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves . look  that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media  we don  t need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional . there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin  s wing . as such  garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world . the producers seem to thing we won  t be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it .  ironically  even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor   the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime  but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons  making several horrible mistakes  and then  redeeming  himself  even at the cost of three other innocent lives . honestly  i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs . amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor  it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment  i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money . i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind  ron howard and akiva goldsman  s sugary  sweet adaptation of the life of john nash  which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can  t get enough of . the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years  and viewers  who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves  buy these fake portraits hook  line  and sinker .  br    br   look  i  m certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn  t . my point is  with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man  why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths  why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films  why can they not trust us to think for ourselves   can we

       " 'talk about a blast opening   trampa infernal  has the coolest opening credits ever  guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary  friday the   th  theme  tsh  tsh  tsh  ha  ha  ha   the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables . promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher  backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes . two extremely competitive and testosterone  overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar . according to a newspaper article  there  s a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it . the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls . upon arrival  however  it quickly becomes obvious they  re not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve . after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers  this early    s mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid . the formula is simplistic but efficient  the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful . the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers  as he also uses a self  made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face . the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric  which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences  and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood . the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular .  trampa internal  is a mexican slasher  survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre .

       " 'there are many adaptations of charlotte bront  s classic novel  jane eyre   and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best . the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a    min . length  consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel . the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine  s life .  br    br   there are three tv mini series  released in        and     . the     version is not only the worst of these three  but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film . the novel  s beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones  and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel . what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book  but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set . it is a silly soap opera  in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the     ies by mistake . this  jane eyre   as it dares to call itself  is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte bront .  br    br   the     version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr . rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length . but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen . at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen  and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane  s voice  overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess . and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured . another problem is the casting of the main characters . sorcha cusack  s portrayal of jane as a bold  self  confident  worldly  wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model  and michael jayston  although a good actor  does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester . although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience .  br    br   all the faults of the    version stand corrected in the tv mini series of    with timothy dalton and zelah clarke . although from a purist  s point of view timothy dalton is too handsome  tall and lean to be rochester  he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an imposing physical presence  great magnetism and an air of self  assurance and authority . and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly . but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester  s character . of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all rochester  s harshness  nearly insolence  his moodiness and abruptness  as well as his humorous side  his tenderness  his solicitude and deep  frantic love . dalton  s handling of charlotte bront  s language is equally superb . even rochester  s most far  fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them . he is the definitive rochester  unsurpassed and unsurpassable  and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor .  br    br   zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester . she portrays exactly the jane of the novel  an outwardly shy  reserved and guarded young woman  but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will . she catches beautifully the duality in jane  s character her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand  and her fire and passion on the other  her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong . she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight .  br    br   as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the    version  but with one important difference the dialogues are shortened in this version  but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged . thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech  while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte bront  s language . and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured .  br    br   the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the    series . it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel  where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane  s life . it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel  and the only one which does full justice to the novel  s pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding . timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill . he renders with almost painful intensity rochester  s anguish as he realizes jane  s resolution to leave him  his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him . it is a heartbreaking  almost devastating  scene  which will stay with the viewer for a long time .  br    br   with even the smaller roles perfectly cast  an excellent script and two ideal

       " 'i found this show really late at night  and gave it a try . it  s a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night  if you catch my drift . its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children . it  s something i indulge in whenever i find it on  which is rare  maybe i should actually check the listings  haha  . . . . . and the tension between joe and nick is so cute . like any good chick flick  you really get emotionally involved in the characters . good ol  louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories   so apparently i must complete   lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid  so i guess i  ll tell you a bit more . the kids are played by talented actors and actresses  and the settings are lovely and nature  filled   another thing you don  t see much on television . i hope everyone gives it a shot . i recognize and am fully aware that it  s sappy  but it  s good heart . like i said before  it  s refreshing .

       " 'since the title is in english and imdb lists this show  s primary language as english  i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing       as presented in the bandai released dvd set . my actual review for the whole series is under imdb  s entry of   shin kid senki gundam w        .  br    br   very little is changed in respect to plot  script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in . purists can stick to japanese all they want  but for a more  realistic  experience i recommend the english track since all the characters  except heero yuy  are not japanese .  most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non  japanese asians .  for one thing  the characters  personalities come across more  directly  than in the japanese version . the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give  or  take performances but a very well cast group of actors .  br    br   wing gundam  s pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity . voiced by mark hildreth who  s deadpan delivery can be criticized as  bad acting  but it matches heero  s personality very well .  br    br   deathscythe gundam  s duo maxwell  ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends . he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show  masterfully played by scott mcneil . he may sound a little too old for his age  but duo  s english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one .  br    br   trowa  the pilot of heavyarms  is a lost lonely soul who  s only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him  he only knows how to kill  not to befriend . kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton .  br    br   quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand . a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl  and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version  but a bona fide typical   year old guy .  br    br   the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over  the  top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa .  br    br   relena darlian sounds older in english  voiced by lisa ann bailey . this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story  her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development .  br    br   zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version . both voices bring out different sides to the same character . his japanese voice is haughty  authoritative and commands respect  keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature . his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued  sounding more devious and  snake  like   highlighting zechs  secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals .  br    br   the members of oz are a mixed bag really . treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down  to  earth performance compared to his larger  than  life japanese style of speaking . however  lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds . . . . . . . . . bored most of the time . the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either .  br    br   i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds . the maganac corp  s voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents . the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility .  br    br   despite underwhelming acting from the side characters  the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over  the  top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing  s script . very faithful to the original japanese script  keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics  war and human nature . sadly  it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script .

       " 'okay  my title is kinda lame  and almost sells this flick short . i remember watching siskel  ebert in    talking about this movie  and then playing a clip or two . not being a rap  conscious guy  although i could identify snoop dogg  vanilla ice  and mc hammer music   i wasn  t much interested when they started talking about the film . but then  se showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name  using some  shady  logic and a bunch of  made up  facts   and then another scene where the band  and their rival band  both visit a school to promote getting involved  and  of course  nwh comes up with some  info  about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee  . so i filed it away that i should see this movie .  br    br   a couple of years later  this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it  only to laugh my butt off for hours . yes  it has a  spinal tap  kind of rhythm to it . . . even the documentarist takes essentially the same  tone  in setting up the clips  and the band follows a similar path  what i now call the  behind the music  phenomenon  smalltime band has good chemistry  gets famous  too much money too fast  squabbling  drugs  some type of death  band breaks up  then reconciles  finishing with a hope for more albums in the future  and fade to black  . the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap  you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . but tap drags at some points  and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . oh  this is his rant about the backstage food  this is spot where he wants the amp to go to  eleven   this is the spot where the guy makes the pint  sized stonehenge  etc . . .  br    br   contrasting to foabh  which seems to have more  unexpected  humor . you can see some of it coming  but there isn  t a big setup for every joke . sometimes  the jokes just kinda flow . cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . also  the direct references to vanilla ice  hammer  and a bunch of other caricature  type rappers really worked well . this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs  and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . and the songs . is  my peanuts  better than  big bottom   from spinal tap   i don  t know  but they  re both damn funny . tone def  s awful video during his  awakening  phase is so bizarre  yet so funny .  br    br   i could go on awhile  but save your time and don  t waste it on cb  . i watched the first half hour  and got bored . you don  t get bored on foabh . there are slightly less funny moments  but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste  name ripoffs if i  ve ever heard any  discover they  ve been sharing the same girl . . . . at one point  you  ve got those two pointing guns at each other  and the next thing you know  the manager  the photographer  the girl  and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other  switching targets back and forth . and  of course  someone does get shot .  br    br   i did find it odd that nwh  s managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap  s drummers  although none spontaneously combusted  i don  t think  . there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw  spinal tap  prior to writing this film  although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip  hop . while some similarities exist  the humor is different  and the movie seems more like a real documentary  maybe because we don  t recognize a single actor in this thing  even the guy who played  lamar  from  revenge of the nerds   . all in all  this movie has  in my opinion   street cred  . kinda like nwh .

    "# Project 5: Making our Network More Efficient<a id='project_5'></a>\n",
    "**TODO:** Make the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that, you can do the following:\n",
    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.\n",
    "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
    ">* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
    ">* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."
