<h1>Sentimental Analysis On IMDB Moview Reviews Using Artificial Neural Networks And Framing the Neural Networks From Scratch</h1>
<h2>This Project also helps You how to Frame a Problem For Artificial Neural Networks</h2>

<h2>Curating The Moview Reviews Dataset: This Step Involves Finding the Correlation Between the Features(Reviews) And the Labels</h2>

<h3>Neural Networks is Typically Composed of Input Layers (#What We Know), The Hidden Layers which generally extract the hidden patterns in the data and the Output Layer(#what we want to know)</h3>
